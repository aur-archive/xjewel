       xjewel - Jewel for X11 Copyright 1992 by David Cooper

       This game was originally written by Yoshihiro Satoh of HP.
       I  have made a modest attempt to replicate Domain/JewelBox
       under X.

       I have somewhat rudely taken the bitmaps from the original
       game  and  created this version.  I hold the copyright for
       the code, as I created it, but I  hold  no  claim  to  the
       bitmaps which were freely distributed with the Domain ver-
       sion.

       NOTE: I have attempted to reach the holder of the original
       copyright  to  ascertain his acceptance for the release of
       this game, he did not, or was not able to reply.

       REDISTRIBUTION in source or binary  from  is  permited  as
       long  as adequate notation of the originators is retained,
       including the developer of  the  original  Domain/Jewlbox,
       Yoshihiro Satoh.

       USE  AT  YOUR  OWN RISK AND PERIL, I MAKE NO CLAIM OF USE-
       ABILITY OR WARANTY.
